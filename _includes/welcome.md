Hello!  I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Austin [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu) and co-founder of coding education company [Trinket](https://trinket.io).

As is idiomatic for these kinds of websites, here you can find:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* My [research interests](research)
* Information for prospective student [advisees](advising)
* Information on [my teaching](teaching)

A selection of my non-academic writings and press is below. You can find my recent publications on [Academia.edu](https://utexas.academia.edu/elliott) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OBskYc4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/elliotthauser) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/hauspoor).  

If you find a typo, have a formatting fix or want to help make this site less hacky, the code is [on Github](https://github.com/eah13/elliotthauser.com).  I welcome contributions, especially from those new to open source!
