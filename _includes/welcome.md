Welcome!  This is a list of my recent writings, both on this blog and elsewhere.  I'll also throw in press every now and then. I hope you enjoy them.

Here's a list of some [stuff I do](bio.html).

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/elliotthauser), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/hauspoor), or [G+](http://plus.google.com/+elliotthauser).  

If you find a typo, have an formatting fix or want to help make this site less hacky, the code is [on Github](https://github.com/eah13/elliotthauser.com).  I welcome contributions, especially from those new to open source!
