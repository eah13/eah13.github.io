* Here's a list of some [stuff I do](bio.html).  
* Here's a list of [tools I use as a startup founder](tools.html).

If you find a typo, have an formatting fix or want to help make this site less hacky, the code is [on Github](https://github.com/eah13/elliotthauser.com).  I welcome contributions, especially from those new to open source!
