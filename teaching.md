My teaching interests include organization of information, information studies, and technical skills such as software product management, research cyberinfrastructure, and programming.

For an example of my teaching, a recent graduate programming course website is available [here](https://inf380p.github.io), with source code [on Github](https://github.com/inf380p). I utilize in-browser educational tools like [Trinket](https://trinket.io) and [Runestone](https://runestone.academy) in my programming courses.

I also periodically supervise doctoral and masters students in independent studies on topics of mutual interest. See my [research](research) for a summary of my interests and [advising](advising) for my approach to working with students.
