My teaching interests include datafication, social informatics, qualitative research methods in technical sites, and sociotechnical systems analysis. Recent courses I've taught are listed on [my faculty page](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=425). 

I also periodically supervise doctoral and masters students in independent research on my projects or topics of mutual interest. See my [research](research) for a summary of my interests and [advising](advising) for my approach to working with student researchers.
