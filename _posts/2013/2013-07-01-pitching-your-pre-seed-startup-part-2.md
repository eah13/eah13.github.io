*What are YOUR goals?  This is the first question you should ask yourself when looking for investors. It's the question I'll leave you with, because it'll take some time to think through. 

You need to know what your goal is so that you can effectively communicate that goal. Plenty of investors will not be a good fit for you to achieve your goal, and that's OK. Just make sure you keep the conversation focused on goals so that all parties can quickly evaluate whether a deal makes sense.*
