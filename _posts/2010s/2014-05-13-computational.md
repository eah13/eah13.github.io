An interview with Physics teacher Pat Counts.

*"Pat: For years the printed textbook has typically been a central component of physics courses. But physics is a science of change, and static textbook pages donâ€™t convey change very effectively. Computers have the potential to provide a much more dynamic environment for modeling change than do ink and paper, and the best learning takes place when students interact with the concepts they are studying."*
