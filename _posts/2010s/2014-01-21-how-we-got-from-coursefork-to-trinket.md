*Today we announced that our forthcoming beta will include a new brand: trinket. This is a story of how our team has helped draw this renewed vision, new brand, and new product out of us by asking us important questions and challenging our decisions. It's a story of needing to shake out of our comfort zone, and for me, personally, it's required a shift from visionary to true leader. I hope it's a story that other founders will find useful.*
