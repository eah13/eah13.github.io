*"Founders need a relationship dedicated to their emotional and mental well-being that’s totally separate from their startup. While many have friends or partners that fill this role, the reciprocity of these relationships isn’t well suited to the tremendous needs founders will have during the frequent and intense periods of crisis every startup experiences on its long journey toward success, or more likely, failure.*

*But there is one relationship that’s different. There is one relationship that can not only withstand the extreme pressures of startups, but is actually designed to absorb them. And that’s the relationship founders have with a therapist, coach, or counselor.*

*Unlike a trusted investor, a therapist has no stake in your success or failure. Unlike a significant other, a therapist has no need for reciprocation. And unlike your cofounder, your therapist isn’t wrestling with their own doubts about your startup or prospects for success."*
