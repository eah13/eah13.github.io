title: Beginning Coders need Visual Examples
---

*"When I’ve brought visual examples like this into classrooms, kids are instantly engaged.  They can see that there’s something ‘in there’: the turtle.  I’ve personified the variable, so they can realize that her name is ‘Tina’ and she’s the Turtle shape on the canvas.  Their minds immediately leap to what else Tina could do.  I’ve got their attention and we’re ready to dig into the example, change some of the code, and really understand what’s going on."*
