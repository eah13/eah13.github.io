*"Humble companies know their place is to augment and amplify their customers, not replace them. Their products equip teachers and students to better do things in the classroom, rather than consume materials. More and more of the most exciting young companies are focusing on building tools for teacher and student success instead of hawking pre-packaged consumables. This isn’t just a coincidence, it’s also a recipe for success in the industry."*
