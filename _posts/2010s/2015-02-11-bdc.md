title: Breadth and Depth in Startup Metrics
---

*"Geoff Ralston recently wrote a post on his brilliant (b * d) / c formula for prioritizing product development features. You should definitely [read his post](http://blog.geoffralston.com/startup-priorities) if you haven’t. I call it Ralston’s Unified Theorem of Product Development.*

*As he notes in his post, though, the key to success with this formula is picking the right metric to use with it. Are there any more specific guidelines we can use to pick these metrics? I think so."*
