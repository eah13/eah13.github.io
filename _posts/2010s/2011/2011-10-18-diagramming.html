Omnigraffle is the Big Kahuna of diagraming programs.  I use it extensively.  There are complaints I have about it, but they are the kind of complaints you have when you find a piece of software so useful you know all of its quirks.  That said, Omni group's software ergonomics pretty much beat anyone's.

Visio is the de-facto standard for Windows diagramming.  I don't like to use Windows, so don't have much experience creating content with Visio. You may like it though.  Not to be confused with <a href="http://www.vizio.com/">Vizio</a>.

Gliffy is a neat web tool that wants to be a web-enabled version of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>. Not only is it a great diagraming option for Macs, it's one of the best I've found that works with Linux. (sorry, <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia">Dia</a>...)

It runs on the web and there is a free version. It's pretty powerful, and certainly more convenient than box-bound software. It's not as powerful as Omnigraffle, though, and the interface isn't as refined (for instance, there's no equivalent to holding down alt to duplicate elements).

I used Gliffy back when I was just starting to learn about ER diagrams:

I haven't found it useful enough to upgrade beyond the 5 documents you get for free.  Instead, I bought Omnigraffle.

<strong>UX Evaluation</strong>

TechSmith's <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/morae">Morae</a> is an interesting- and very expensive - entry into the UX Analysis Space.  It combines screen &amp; webcam capture with indexed notetaking form multiple observers.

I'm sure there are more programs in the UX space.  Stay tuned.
