**Update:  Mendeley is now the center of my scholarly workflow.  In about 8 months of using it, I've accumulated 1500 scholarly papers from school, the lab, and my personal research, using about a gigbyte of cloud storage. How else could I have managed?

It offers syncing with a web account (500MB free), so my citations AND pdfs are always nearby.  It allows group joining/sharing of PDFs (though the group has to be closes/restricted access, to avoid copyright violations, I suppose). It's got an excellent full-screen PDF reader and annotator:

There's even an iPhone app that lets you read or send citations and papers from your phone.

I really dig it.  I'm using it manage all of my class readings (extra love to professors who provide links to PDFs), take notes, and collect interesting citations.  Along with [intlink id="340" type="post"]OmniFocus[/intlink], it's an indispensable part of me getting things done.

Highly recommended.  It's free-as-in-beer, which means you get some in the hopes that you buy more.  I think it's definitely worth it.  I'll likely start paying for web space once/if my 500MB gets filled.

<em>Ed.:  I started paying for extra space, then got mondo space for free when I became UNC's <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/advisors/">Mendeley Advisor</a>  in May 2011.  But I'd still be paying the $5/month even it it wasn't free.  It's that awesome.</em>

**[Older] Update:  I got started on <strong>Mendeley</strong>.  Am setting it up now.

I also have set up Zotero, but don't really like it because it's stuck in Firefox.  I use Safari most of the time because Firefox is so dern slow.

Even if I don't ever use Zotero myself, this integration means that I can join Zotero-based groups.  That was a big concern for me: making sure the system I chose could play well with others.  I'm at a grand total of 3 sources right now.

So far I'm impressed with Mendeley's link-based import (even though it utilizes pop-ups).

As I put Mendeley through its paces, I'll pay particular attention to:
<ul>
	<li>Adding web-based sources</li>
	<li>Adding sources directly from the Library's page</li>
	<li>Annotating and noting on sources (e.g. pp. 112-123, or 'as contra Foucault')</li>
	<li>Searching through online groups and publically available bibliographies</li>
	<li>Searching through others' annotations</li>
</ul>

I learned of <a href="http://heuristscholar.org">Heurist Scholar</a> during the <a href="http://virtualcitiesdigitalhistories.web.unc.edu/">Virtual Cities Digital Histories Symposium</a>.  Haven't tried it.

<em>The below written before I had chosen a system to try:</em>

When I was an Undergrad at Duke they provided <a href="http://www.endnote.com/">Endnote</a> (it was v4 back then if I recall) as a citation manager.  The newer versions of Microsoft Word have had citation support through the powerful, underutilized, and clunky document field functionality (the same features that will give you a Table of Contents or even a linked index).

<a href="http://www.lib.unc.edu/instruct/refworks/whatis.html">RefWorks</a> is UNC's offering to its students and faculty.  It's a web-based citation tool and, like all niche tools, has come core functionalities that make it worth considering and some drawbacks that users love to hate.

<a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is the free open source offering.  I'm a big fan of free open source, so I really want Zotero to rock.  And it looks like it's come a long way and does rock.  See niche software comment above, though.  It's first on the list to test because if it's good enough I'm done looking.  I'll not be at UNC forever, and I don't want to have to pay for access to my citations if I am using RefWorks.

<a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteUlike</a> is another contender.  Recommended by University of Chicago's Mark Olsen.

<a href="http://www.mendeley.com">Mendeley</a> is another contender, with both a web and an application-based client. First mentioned to me by <a href="http://jasonpriem.com/">Jason Priem.</a>

I'm currently selecting from these alternatives because I desperately need to manage my lit.  Stay tuned for thoughts and reflections.

Aside:  George Mason's <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Center for History and New Media</a> is the impetus behind Zotero.  As this software becomes more and more useful in the production of scholarly work, it's interesting to factor a project like Zotero into the mix.  The scholar who provides serious and ongoing help to the production of Zotero may benefit his field- and all of academia- in a way that's hard to measure.  Ultimately, unless his institution supports this contribution, his open-source contributions will be deleterious to his tenure chances.  I suppose the non-tenure track staff/associate research prof plug belongs here, as well as a big up to tenured profs who spend time &amp; energy on open source.
