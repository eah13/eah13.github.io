Growing up, I was the kid who never took notes or did homework assignments.  I would read alot, but not always the things that were assigned for class...  The upshot of all this is that I'm uncommonly knowledgeable about random things and have stunted organizational skills.

I do homework now (mostly reading), and man, it takes a lot of time and planning!  I've had to impose order on my mind and on my time to get it all done.  I started trying to think in a structured way about tasks, priorities, and my capacity to get things done.
<h2>There's an App for that?</h2>
A few months ago I started looking into a to-do list program.  There are millions of them.  Some are a one basic list, others have nesting and categorization, and some offer syncing across all your devices.  The good ones seem to be expensive (though there are some free ones to try too).  Dig through <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Category:Todo_Software">this list</a> if you'd like to see some offerings.

So, not wanting a new system before I could prove to myself that I could use a to-do list at all, I decided to use what I already had.  Last semester (Fall 2010) I started using the to-do list capabilities of Calendar for Mac, synced using MobileMe.  Basic, sturdy, but with an egregious lack of support on the iPhone.  The interface was clearly not tweaked, either.  Apple seriously fell short on this.  Even the recent major calendar update had no changes to the to-do list.  Bummer.

But using a to-do list was great!  I could put all my readings, etc in there and, though the list itself got HUGE, Calendar let me set it to only display those items due within the timeframe I was looking at (usually a week at a time).  Which was great because I also started using the Mac calendar system heavily (again synced with MobileMe), and I could tick off items while planning my week.

Somewhere along the way I started to hear about the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">Getting Things Done</a> system. This isn't a computer program but a system described in one of those self-help type books on productivity.  I'm extremely suspicious of such things.  But I'm always willing to give a suspicious listen.  The basics of the system are to state your goals, align your projects with your goals, break your projects into actionable items, and do your items within their necessary contexts.  I started planning in the GTD style, and quickly found that a simple to-do list won't, so to speak, do.  May sound confusing at first, but, as I hope to show with <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a>, the software based on GTD I've decided to use, it's pretty powerful.

I'm still not buying the book, though...
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342" title="Screen shot 2011-01-14 at 5.25.47 PM" src="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-14-at-5.25.47-PM.png" alt="" width="454" height="386" /></a>OmniFocus offers a 14 day free trial period.  The first time I tried OmniFocus (spring 2010) I didn't quite get it.  Now I know that, before trying a heavy-duty productivity program,</p>

<ol>
	<li>you should first start living with a perpetual to-do list and get used to that first and</li>
	<li>you have to have a LOT of things to do before nested to-do lists, projects, and contexts really pay off.</li>
</ol>
So my experience with the Mac to-do list wasn't all for nought and my crazy grad school schedule ends up being a plus.  I'd suggest picking a free to-do list solution, living with it for a week or two, and then doing the OmniFocus 14-day trial.  Make sure it's a busy time, too- otherwise you won't see the benefits.

<em>Aside:  There's no free trial on the iPhone version of Omnifocus, but, if you find yourself in the moderately-in-need of a to-do program category, this might be the better solution.  It's got most of the major functionality and if most of your to-do aren't connected to links to pdfs (i.e. grad school reading homework), you may not miss the stuff the desktop app has.  Also, the desktop software is a whopping $80 ($50 for students), while the iPhone app is only $20.  For those of you hesitant to buy software, seriously consider this.  It's a great app under active development.</em>

<strong>The Library</strong>

  <dl id="attachment_341" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px;"> <dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-14-at-10.19.14-AM.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-343" title="Screen shot 2011-01-14 at 10.19.14 AM" src="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-14-at-10.19.14-AM-1024x658.png" alt="" width="614" height="395" /></a></dt> </dl> <dl id="attachment_343" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 624px;"> <dd class="wp-caption-dd">Screenshot of my Projects Library.  This view is where I do my planning, listing out all the actionable things I can think of for each project.  There's even a place, the Inbox, to dump to-dos and assign them to projects later on.</dd> </dl>
The Library is where you plan.  Think of all of your goals, and make sure you've got a project that corresponds to each.  So, if you want to keep in touch with friends, make the Keep in Touch with Friends Project.  Then start listing the actionable items (buy stationary, set up facebook account, write a letter to Johnny, friend Martha on facebook) within that project.  You can make items recurring (though the recurrence support is a little bit basic...), to support Write Martha a Letter popping up every 2 months, call Johnny every week, etc.

If other Projects are related to each other, such as your classes in grad school, just group them in a folder.  You can even nest projects within other projects.

<strong><em>Focusing</em></strong>

A great thing about organizing things this way is that you can highlight a project or folder and Focus (Ctrl-Cmd- F).  This will hide everything not connected with the project(s) or folder(s) you selected.  This means that you can forget about Martha long enough to get your schoolwork done.  It also lets you make a to-do list of fun stuff (yes, fun stuff) that you can focus on during the weekends.  Forgetting about other stuff is crucial to getting the thing at hand done, and OmniFocus supports it.

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl id="attachment_434" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 584px;"> <dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-02-18-at-9.30.01-AM.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-434  " title="Screen shot 2011-02-18 at 9.30.01 AM" src="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-02-18-at-9.30.01-AM-1024x624.png" alt="" width="574" height="350" /></a></dt></dl>

The screenshot above includes an item, 'Revise Personal Productivity Post'.  ...Check!
<p style="text-align: left;">Notice that I have lots of folders within 'School' and they're not all relevant all the time.  So, for instance, when I'm doing my homework, I'll focus only on the 'Class' folder to screen out stuff like the W-9 I have to fill out, etc.</p>
<strong>Contexts</strong>

<div class="mceTemp">
  <dl id="attachment_341" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px;"> <dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-14-at-5.59.29-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-345" title="Screen shot 2011-01-14 at 5.59.29 PM" src="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-14-at-5.59.29-PM.png" alt="" width="572" height="422" /></a></dt> </dl> <dl id="attachment_345" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 582px;"> <dd class="wp-caption-dd">Contexts help you tackle tasks that require similar resources - going to the Library, for instance - at the same time, regardless of which project they're for.</dd> </dl></div>
Contexts are a way of looking at tasks through the lens of what resources you have.  For instance, say you're on your Mac and want to get some things done.  The Mac context allows you to filter out tasks that requre your girlfriend or being on campus, so you can concentrate on what you can get done now.  I really like this view for things like getting library books, filling out paperwork in x office, and going to the grocery store.

Doing what you can now is a great way to be super productive.  Need to grab a library book?  Add the task, select the Library context, and put it on your calendar during the week.  Any other books you add to the list in the meantime will be waiting for you in the Library context so you can make sure to get them all done when you're there.  Same thing with groceries, filling out forms in your department's office, and responding to emails.  You can even make a person a context, so you can remember to do specific things the next time you see your significant other or your tax guy.

<strong>Interface</strong>

Like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, another excellent product from the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">Omni</a>,  the interface is excellent.  I have some small gripes with it here and  there, but in most cases there is a way to do everything I initially  complain about that makes better sense than how I would've done it.   That's the classic tradeoff in interfaces- intutive may not always equal  efficient.

<div class="mceTemp">
  <dl id="attachment_341" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px;"> <dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-14-at-10.24.41-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-341 " title="Screen shot 2011-01-14 at 10.24.41 AM" src="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/files/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-14-at-10.24.41-AM-300x224.png" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></dt></dl>
</div>

That said, in other cases, like the menu bar to the right, it works  exactly the way you'd expect.  You can tell it to display overdue (red)  and/or due-soon (orange) tasks by context (as shown).  The icon will  always show you the total.  (I was busy when I took the screenshot to  the right...right now, the icon only says 2, one of which is writing  this post...).

As a professional ap, pretty much everything is customizable.  So,  above, where I told you that Red means overdue...well, you can pick any  color you want.  The fonts for various sections of the ap are all  separately formatable in the preferences.  Keep that in mind and take a second look at those screenshots.

<strong>Upcoming:  iPhone app review</strong>

OmniFocus supports syncing across multiple macs pretty well, but it also syncs with its spiffy iPhone app.  I'll review that app, with screenshots.
