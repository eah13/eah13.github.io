There's a big difference between knowing no Linux and knowing a little Linux.  I highly recommend getting to a little Linux.  It's so easy!

<strong>Try Before You Buy</strong>

...Well, the Linux is free so you'll never have to buy it.  But the best way to figure out what it is and play around is using VirtualBox.  <strong>You can load Linux within your current operating system. </strong>Killer.  Oracle spearheads the free/opensource project, so you know it's got some firepower behind it.  One day I'll post a tutorial on setting up VB.

After you load it you'll be able to create new virtual machines.  Simply download the .iso for your preferred distribution (see below) and mount it as a virtual CDrom.

<strong>Start Here: Ubuntu</strong>

Ubuntu is quickly becoming the standard for non-server, non-expert Linux.  That said, there is perhaps the largest community of experts working to tweak and improve it.  It's also backed by a company- Canonical Ltd- which, despite the philosophical reservations of some idealists, makes the end product higher quality in my opinion.  You can even buy hardware pre-installed with Ubuntu from system76.com.  Pretty sweet.

Ubuntu is focused on ease-of use, and it delivers.  It's also customizable and powerful.  A great blend, ready for almost anything you'd like to throw at it.

### Research Computing: the RedHat Clan

Red Hat is another corporation that backs/spearheads open source projects.  RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, and even <a href="http://tarheellinux.unc.edu/wiki/index.php/TarHeel_Linux">TarHeel Linux</a> all owe some aspect of their existence to Red Hat the company.  <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhel/">RedHat Enterprise Linux</a> is their flagship product, and is the backbone for a significant chunk of the Internet we know and love.  <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> is the community-developed version of their software where they test out new features.  It's re-versioned <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Time_based_release_schedule">every 6 months or so</a>, whether it needs it or not, so it's great for cutting-edge, not so great for your standard user (that said, it's much much more stable than even a few years ago).  <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS </a>is RedHat Linux with the logos taken out. <a href="http://tarheellinux.unc.edu">TarHeel Linux</a> is UNC's version of RedHat Linux supported for research computing.  Check out <a href="http://help.unc.edu/6020">Emerald</a>, UNC's research cluster, for info on how to submit massive MatLab or Mathematica jobs to 700 processors.

### The Fun world of RAM only: <strong><a href="http://puppylinux.org">Puppy Linux</a></strong>  

Puppy will fit on a small thumb drive.  It's blazing fast and tiny.  More soon.  

### Style, Substance, Slimness: <strong><a href="http://crunchbanglinux.org/">#!CrunchBang Linux</a></strong>  

I've just started playing with this distro virtually.  It's very slick.  More soon.
