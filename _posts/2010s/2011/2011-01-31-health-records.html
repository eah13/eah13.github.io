This is a stub of health records and health informatics standards and resources.  As a <a href="http://chip.unc.edu">Carolina Health Informatics Program</a> student, I'm studying all of these.

The department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University maintains the <a href="http://med.dmi.columbia.edu/">Medical Entities Dictionary</a>, a concept-oriented repository with links to many of the vocabularies and codes below.

The Veteran's Association maintains an open source health records/clinical support system called <a href="http://www.virec.research.va.gov/DataSourcesName/VISTA/VISTA.htm">VISTA</a>

<a href="http://www.hl7.org/">HL7</a> is a pioneering data interchange format for health data.  It focuses on interpretability between different formats.    This allows specialist medical fields to choose best-of-breed equipment and information systems without compromising the ability to communicate with other aspects of the health system.

<a href="http://loinc.org/">LOINC</a> is a controlled vocabulary for clinical and laboratory results.  This allows standardization of observations like "patient had a temperature of 105"  "Strep positive" etc.

<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/cpt.shtml">CPT </a>is an established standard of medical procedures maintained by the American Medical Association.  For instance, '26010' is 'Drainage of finger abscess; simple'

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ICD-9_codes">ICD-9</a>, ICD-9-CM, and ICD10 are standardized, hierarchical controlled vocabularies that have their origin in linking billing with the patient's chief complaint.  Like all controlled vocabularies, they have their problems.  Also, since they're used for billing, they're not perfectly representative of diagnoses, etc.  They demonstrate the huge potential of standardization, though, and are the basis of many secondary analyses of clinical data.

<a href="http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/">SNOMED</a> is another medical controlled vocabulary that focuses on coverage scope and multilingual support.

<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/">UMLS</a> is maintained by the National Library of Medicine.  It is the most comprehensive system (6.4 million concepts from over 100 source vocabularies) and subsumes and interrelates many of the systems above.  It includes a <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/index.html">Metathesaurus</a>, a <a href="http://semanticnetwork.nlm.nih.gov/">Semantic network</a>, the <a href="http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/Specialist/Home/index.html">SPECIALIST Lexicon</a>, and a <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/metamorphosys/index.html">Metamorphosis configuration tool</a>.  There have been concerns with this service's efficiency and precision, but it's pretty much the only attempt to unify so many standards.
