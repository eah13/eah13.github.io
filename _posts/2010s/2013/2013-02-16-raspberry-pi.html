My wonderful wife Erin bought me a Raspberry Pi for my birthday in November 2012.  It's changed the way I think about computers and coding education.  I wrote a long form post about my latest ideas <a href="http://hastac.org/blogs/eah13/2012/12/02/code-and-computation-humans-syllabus-sketch">on HASTAC.org</a>.  You can read more by checking out my <a href="http://bit.ly/elliottgplus">G+ feed</a>, and below are some selected posts from it.

&nbsp;

I started <a href="http://comp-core.org">Comp-core.org</a>, the Computational Core Curriculum, to collect and collaborate on course materials (and code, via our github repos) for those of us who teach this material.  It's small now  I first got this idea from a panel I moderated in the Fall at UNC called Code in the Classroom.  A little wrap-up of that event, which featured profs from Duke and UNC, is <a href="http://hastac.org/blogs/eah13/2012/10/05/code-classroom-wrapup">here</a>.

So check it out and <a href="mailto:eah13@email.unc.edu">shoot me an email</a> or  join comp-core's open google group if you want to contribute!
