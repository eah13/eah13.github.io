A conversation with ExitEvent founder Joe Procopio.

Joe:

*The Startup Giveback idea came up at an event back in September. Elliott brought it up, and it had obviously been on his mind, during a conversation with me and Adam Klein over drinks. The idea is for the Triangle entrepreneurial community to create its own charitable fund, in the form of an endowment that will benefit local charities perpetually. It's a big goal, which is why I like it and why I'm betting other entrepreneurs will like it.*
