*Basically, HASTAC is a sounding board and sketchpad for ideas.  Pretty much all of the posts I've written have felt experemental, tests of ideas.  The reponses I get are always energizing, as I hope my comments are to others' posts.  Here is a case study in how posting some experemental ideas on HASTAC has blossomed into real-world expereinces, virtual connections, and tangible improvements to my ideas.*
