*"My original plan with Coursefork was to take the summer, go into a room with lots of Red Bull, and code a prototype. I'm not an amazing coder, so I estimated it would take me 2-3 months to get an alpha. In that alternate reality, I wouldn't be writing this essay, I'd be trying to test out my prototype in front of users.*

*By building a team and giving the idea away to them, I was able to see a proof of concept built in a weekend, deploy an alpha in June, raise angel funding, and end up here at The Startup Factory."*
