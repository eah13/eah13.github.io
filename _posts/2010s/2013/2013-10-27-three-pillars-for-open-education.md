*Despite the ambitious title, I can't claim I know for sure how we'll build education's open future.  But by examining the history of open source, I think we can see what shape the answer will take.  And so this is the approach we're taking with Coursefork: the hypothesis that the future of education looks a lot like the present of software and that both are inexorably becoming open.  

There are three areas that we believe educators must develop if we are to make this future a reality: Community, Leadership, and Technology.*
