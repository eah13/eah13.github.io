<p style="text-align: left;">I've started a startup called <a href="http://coursefork.org">Coursefork</a> with cofounders <a href="http://ericmartindale.com">Eric Martindale </a>and <a href="http://www.brianpmarks.com/">Brian Marks</a>.  We're an open education startup looking to become the foundation for education's open future, where educators of all types can create, share, and modify course materials for anything from a workshop to a university course.  I'll be open-sourcing my materials for the graduate level programming course I'll be teaching at UNC in the fall on Coursefork.  In the meantime, <a href="http://coursefork.org">check us out</a>!</p>
