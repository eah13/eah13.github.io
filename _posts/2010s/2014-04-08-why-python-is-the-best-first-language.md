<em>5 things students need from a 1st language:

* A great experience on Day 1. Much like the first page of a book, students need to be ‘hooked’ early on to have the excitement and curiosity to persevere in the face of the inevitable frustrations of learning something new.  This can be especially important for those who haven’t been exposed to programming from a young age.
* The ability to (eventually) program on the Web. Increasingly, the Web is critical to the profession and craft of programming and students should have Web frameworks available when they’re ready.
* The ability to program desktop applications. While trends are moving more of what we do onto the web, there’s nothing like the immediacy of making and running your first local program.
* An eventually marketable professional skill. While academic or recreational programming is excellent, the skills we teach should also be usable in a professional context should students choose to use them in that way.
* A supportive and welcoming community surrounding the language.  Once again this is crucial for those who haven’t had exposure to coding from a young age.
