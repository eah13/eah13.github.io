***Elliott: We’ve been very excited to see you using our Python trinkets in ways we hadn’t imagined. Your blog does a great job of teaching both Python and computational thinking. What reactions have you gotten from visitors on the new interactive solutions you’ve added?***

***Mike:** The response has been outstanding and I am moving all my solutions to trinkets. Live interaction with Python programs allows anyone to experiment with the results by changing a few parameters, and helps them discover new methods they hadn’t thought of before. My site’s traffic has doubled so far and is breaking records every month since installing trinkets. This has been a very exciting improvement in both exposure and blog usability.*
