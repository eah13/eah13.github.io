***Elliott: How does teaching programming fit with the rest of the NC Museum of Natural Sciences’ education?***

***Walt:** A key concept incorporated into the museum’s educational program is to provide science for a changing world. There are multiple facets of the educational program, but the VisLab is one of three Investigate Labs in the museum, hands-on interactive spaces where the public can engage in scientific methods and use tools employed by scientists. In the VisLab, we focus on data visualization, where we demonstrate multiple ways scientists use computer-based visualization techniques to understand data from various realms of science, and making with electronics, robotics, and 3D printing. Programming is the the unifying theme: the lab is a great example of the application of programming to varied subjects.*
