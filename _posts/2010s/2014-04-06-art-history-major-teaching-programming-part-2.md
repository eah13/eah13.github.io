*Public displays of art have been essential to developing artistic communities throughout history. But at various points in history, groups such as Academies or Guilds controlled when exhibitions happened, who could show work, and what kind of work could be shown. In 19th century Paris, a group of artists organized a series of alternative exhibitions called the Salon des Ind√©pendants that gave artists a direct outlet to the public and other artists, with no mediating Academic jury. Open source code has played a similar role in freedom of expression for programmers over the past few decades, and forms an invaluable tool for those of use who teach code.*
