Inspired by <a href="http://blog.harjtaggar.com/time">this post</a> by Harj Taggar, I took email off of my iPhone in September 2012. After a week or two, it's really helped me stay focused while I'm away from the computer. That, combined with <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">Rescue Time</a> when I'm at my laptop, has helped me be more efficient with the hours I spend working. I'm interested in this both from an information science perspective (when every device can do everything, how do we make space for thought and focus?) and from a personal perspective (how do I achieve what I want to achieve and leave time for life?).  I'll try to pay attention to both aspects.

Harj wrote his post after 6 months, so I'm going to give it plenty of time before I make any sweeping pronouncements.  Stay tuned and I'll post my reflections here.
