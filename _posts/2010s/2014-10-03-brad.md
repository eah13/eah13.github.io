*"Luther College computer science professor Brad Miller is a true innovator and one of our inspirations here at Trinket.  He’s the core maintainer for the Skulpt project, which we use in our Python trinkets, and has built one of the best free online computer science textbook collections around at interactivepython.org.*

*In this interview, we hear about how he got into teaching, his search for better, more interactive resources, and how he uses interactive tools (many of which he created!) in his own classroom.  One of the themes that comes through is how his projects, like all software projects, are embedded within communities of contributors working to solve shared problems.  We’re excited and honored to be a part of some of the exciting work he’s doing!"*
