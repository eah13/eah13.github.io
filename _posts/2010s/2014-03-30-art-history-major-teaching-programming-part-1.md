*The best art history class I ever took was about Dutch art, taught on-site in museums and cathedrals in Belgium and the Netherlands.

Later on in this series I’ll describe how Meetups and Hackathons are the perfect cultural immersion tool for teaching programming, especially to those with relatively little experience.*
