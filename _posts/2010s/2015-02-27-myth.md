title: "The Myth of Serious Code"
---

*"I see too many beginning coders apologizing for ‘just’ learning Ruby or Python or Javascript, as if they were cheating the system somehow. It’s as if there’s some ‘Serious’ coding that they’re not doing. The idea that some coding languages are more Serious than others is a myth that needs to be disproven."*
