**Update: this post is now filled. Welcome to UT Austin, [Boh Chun](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bohkyung-Chun-2)!**

*Come work with me! Applications due May 1, 2022, with an anticipated start on September 1, 2022.*

*"The Living and Working with Robots (LWR) project at UT Austin invites applications for a postdoctoral fellow who conducts sociotechnical research at the intersection of emerging technologies and real-world communities. As a Core Research Project of the Good Systems Research Grand Challenge, the LWR projectâ€™s mission is to build and study robot systems designed to benefit the specific communities in which they are deployed. The selected researcher will become a valued member of our multidisciplinary team, supervised by LWR Co-Lead Dr. Elliott Hauser of the School of Information. The fellow is expected to collaborate on existing LWR projects and to lead one or more independent research projects involving our site. An individualized mentoring and career development plan will include a secondary faculty mentor, chosen by mutual agreement, and peer mentoring opportunities with other UT Austin postdoctoral fellows. Compensation includes salary, benefits, and generous research and travel support."*
