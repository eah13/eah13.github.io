title: "Accomplishing Robotic Autonomy: Sociotechnical Care and Agency in the Laboratory"
paper: true
---

*Effective ethical interventions in emerging technologies such as robotic autonomy
demand situated understandings of the practices that shape them. Drawing upon a year of
participatory ethnography, this study examines the sociomaterial practices used to accomplish robotic agency in an engineering research laboratory. Ironically, the robot was often
a helpless, even pathetic, figure. Roboticists displayed an attitude of surprisingly genuine, diligent, and self-effacing care toward the robot as they helped enable it to perform
basic competencies such as picking up a bottle. Using a practice theory, we show how
roboticists’ care practices, motivated and sustained by anticipatory narratives of robotic
agency, accomplish robotic autonomy. We argue that interventions must acknowledge
and engage with the complex dynamics of technologists’ care to be effective.*
