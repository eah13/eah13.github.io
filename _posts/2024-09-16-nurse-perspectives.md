title: "Nurses’ Perspectives of Care Robots for Assisted Living Facilities"
paper: true
---

*Care robots have been proposed in response to nursing shortages in assisted living facilities (ALFs) and the growing population of older adults. While the use of care robots may improve the general health and well-being of older adults, their introduction changes the work of nursing staff fundamentally, and it has implications for the entire health care system. In developing such technology, it is important to include end users, but so far, the nursing staff’s perspectives have largely been ignored.
This study aims to examine the literature on nursing staff’s attitudes, needs, and preferences related to the use of care robots in ALFs, in order to discover gaps in the literature and guide future research.*

*...[We found] there was consensus among nursing staff that care robots should serve as nursing assistants to reduce workload. Whether robots could or should assist with social tasks remains a question. Further research is needed to mitigate nursing staff’s concerns and understand the socioecological factors that influence their perspectives of care robots and their adoption in Assisted Living Facilities..*
