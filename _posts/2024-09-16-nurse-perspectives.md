title: "Nurses’ Perspectives of Care Robots for Assisted Living Facilities"
paper: true
---

*There was consensus among nursing staff that care robots should serve as nursing assistants to reduce workload. Whether robots could or should assist with social tasks remains a question. Further research is needed to mitigate nursing staff’s concerns and understand the socioecological factors that influence their perspectives of care robots and their adoption in Assisted Living Facilities..*

*With collaborators Katie Trainum and Bo Xie of the UT Austin School of Nursing and Jiaying Liu of the UT iSchool.*
