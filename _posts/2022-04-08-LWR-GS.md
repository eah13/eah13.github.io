*I was honored to present an update on the [Living and Working with Robots](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/projects/living-and-working-with-robots) Core Research Project at the 2022 Good Systems Symposium. In this presentation I use "ethical asterisks" to indicate areas of our research that spark ethical concerns, and "disciplinary daggers" to help translate the general terms I use into their field-specific forms when necessary.*

*Find the full program along with videos of the keynotes, panels, other projects' updates on the [event highlights website](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/news/highlights-2022-good-systems-symposium)*
