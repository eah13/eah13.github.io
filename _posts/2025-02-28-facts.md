title: "Facts in the Machine"
paper: true
---

*This paper presents a theory of the phenomenon of* system-dependent truth *using a performative approach synthesized from the work of [Karen Barad](https://people.ucsc.edu/~kbarad/about.html) and [John Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle). I explain how things are made true by imformation systems by identifying the agencies of* truthmaking *and* factmaking. *I note the ethical issues that this theory helps reveal and point to ways that attention to agency in information systems provides a way of centering justice in information studies.*
