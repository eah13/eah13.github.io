*It's easy to get caught up thinking you're trying to get something from an investor. This is a trap. My test of a good investor is whether they add value in the first meeting though their questions, analysis or advice. So why not return the favor? Find out what—or who—investors are looking for when you meet them and then keep an ear out. It's that easy.*
