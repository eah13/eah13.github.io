title: "Interview: Bringing Robots into the Real World"
---

*[Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/) and I discuss the Living and Working With Robots cross-campus collaboration at UT Austin, funded by [Good Systems](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/good-systems/), a UT Grand Challenge.*

*"Instead of saying, “We have this technology, let’s apply it,” our goal is to identify the right problem before we try to solve it with robotics. We’re prepared to hear responses like “robots don’t make sense here,” and we’re going in with open minds and expect to be surprised. What can library staff and patrons teach us about how they work and what they value? It’s a really different way of working that requires time, patience, and resources."*
