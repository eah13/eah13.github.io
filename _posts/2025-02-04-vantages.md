title: "Shaping Perceptions of Robots With Video Vantages"
paper: true
---

*This study investigates the role of video vantage, "Encounterer" and "Observer", in shaping perceptions of robot social intelligence. Using videos depicting robots navigating hallways and employing gaze cues, results revealed that the Observer vantage consistently yielded higher ratings for perceived social intelligence compared to the Encounterer vantage. These findings underscore the impact of vantage on interpreting robot behaviors and highlight the need for careful design of video-based HRI studies to ensure accurate and generalizable insights for real-world applications.*
