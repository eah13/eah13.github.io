title: "Toward an Etiology of Harm for Knowledge Organization"
paper: true
---

*We define onto-epistemic injustice
as a harm to knowers accomplished simultaneously through what they can or cannot know (epistemic harm proper) and also through what
thereby does or does not exist (ontological harm). Whereas epistemicide is the destruction of the ability to know, onto-epistemicide is the
concomitant destruction of the ability to become. Onto-epistemicide is the cumulative and compounding result of onto-epistemic injustices.*

*Blending insights from document phenomenology with prior examinations of epistemic injustice, we undertake two comparative descriptive
case studies examining how the consensus making processes of classificatory systems of record result in onto-epistemic injustice: 
A) The Medical Subject Headings from the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM-MeSH) and 
B) The Digital Collections from the Alabama Department of Archives and History (ADAH).* 

*In locating documental experiences of knowing and non-documental experiences of becoming, our
onto-epistemic injustice analysis reveals the outcomes in these cases extend beyond harming the ability to know. Rather, knowersâ€™ identities
and most worryingly their ability to become are simultaneously at stake.*
