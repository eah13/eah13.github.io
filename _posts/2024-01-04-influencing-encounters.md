title: "Influencing Incidental Human-Robot Encounters"
paper: true

Relatively simple changes in the quadrupedal Boston Dynamics Spot robot's non-functional movements positively improved pedestrians' evaluations of it. This demonstrates that adjusting the non-functional motion of mobile service robots is a viable intervention to improve incidental encounters with robots in public spaces.
