*I am organizing an open panel (mini-track) at the 2022 Society for Social Studies of Science (4S) Annual Meeting in Cholula, Mexico, with [EunJeong Cheon](https://www.eunjeongcheon.com/), [Justin Hart](http://justinhart.net/), and [Swapna Joshi](https://swapnajoshi.com/). Consider [submitting an abstract](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/ssss/ssss22/) and hope to see you in December!*

*"Living and working in community inevitably occasions experiences of the other, and automated technologies form a new kind of ‘other’ layered into these complex spaces. Phenomena of life and work amidst new technologies are studied by many disciplines. However, have we fully understood how the growth of autonomous technologies within communities is reconfiguring each? Do we have the methodological tools and access to this phenomenon to even gauge whether we understand it? Can we keep the racial, economic, political, and cultural complexity of communities in view when studying automation?"*
