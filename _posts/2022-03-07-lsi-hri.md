title: "HRI 2022 Workshop: Longitudinal Social Impacts of HRI"
---

*I'm a co-organizer of the Longitudinal Social Impacts of HRI over Long-Term Deployments Workshop at ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, along with several other [Living and Working with Robots Co-Leads](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/projects/living-and-working-with-robots): Justin Hart, Samuel Baker, Joydeep Biswas, Junfeng Jiao, and Luis Sentis. Invited speakers include [Reid Simmons](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~reids/), [Maja Matarić](https://robotics.usc.edu/~maja/), [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/), and [Selma Sabanović](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?profile_id=288).*

*"As the world sees robots begin to inhabit places designed for people - delivery robots on city streets, and robots with jobs in airports, shopping malls, and in the home - we expect the importance of understanding these impacts to grow. By bringing together researchers interested in longitudinal studies on real-world human-interactive long-term deployments, we hope to arrive at a clearer vision of how best to study these systems."*
